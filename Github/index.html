				The humble Kings fan who subscribes to The Athletic may have noticed recently the name of <a href="https://theathletic.com/author/hunter-patterson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunter Patterson</a>.
			</p>

            <p class="normal">
                His title is "live news editor," a non-specific job, yet he wrote a few Kings stories this pre-season, including an <a href="https://theathletic.com/4944614/2023/10/09/kings-raptors-preseason-opener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis of the Raptors game</a> and a <a href="https://theathletic.com/4931922/2023/10/05/kings-trey-lyles-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short profile of Trey Lyles</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                His first Kings-specific story, <a href="https://theathletic.com/4111301/2023/01/25/sacramento-kings-light-the-beam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about The Beam</a>, published last April. It gave a brief history of the lazer and considered its cultural import, and quoted, of all people, the head brewer at Moksa Brewing Company in Rocklin. Later, he also wrote some recaps from the Warriors series.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                But overall, Patterson's output has consisted mostly of the "NBA style power rankings," which is <a href="https://theathletic.com/4350691/2023/03/27/nba-style-fashion-jayson-tatum-celtics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a weekly analysis</a> of players' pre-game fashion choices.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                I perked up at seeing Patterson's name under multiple Kings stories. The Athletic hasn't put a body on the Kings beat in a long time. <a href="https://theathletic.com/author/anthony-slater/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Slater</a>, who covers the Warriors for the website, will on occasion drop a Kings article, though to the sensitive Kings fan this dynamic -- a reflection of the masses' priorities -- feels insulting more than anything.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                And it should.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>BACKGROUND</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                The initial mission of The Athletic was to earnestly cover every major U.S. sports franchise; every team would have a beat reporter. That idea set it apart from other sports media companies, and its founders -- Adam Hansmann and Alex Mather, previously colleagues at Strava -- touted that fact.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                "Our ambition is to be the local sports page for every city in the country," Mather said in Oct. 2017.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                To serve that ambition, Hansmann and Mather hired reporters out from under the local newspapers that schooled them, such as when <a href="https://theathletic.com/author/jason-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Jones</a>, who for 16 years had covered the Kings [and Raiders] for the Sacramento Bee, joined The Athletic to work the Kings beat. This hiring strategy was also part of the public pitch.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                "We will wait every local paper out and let them continuously bleed until we are the last ones standing," Mather said. "We will suck them dry of their best talent at every moment. We will make business extremely difficult for them."
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Although the weirdly murderous terms of Mather's comments -- which appear in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,"</a> by Kevin Draper of the New York Times -- are worthy of their own analysis [he isn't merely resigned to the realities of our zero-sum economy; he takes pleasure in seeing himself as a conqueror, apparently], they are beside the point of this piece of writing, except in one respect: They reflect what Draper calls the "brazen... vulture strategy..." of Hansmann and Mather.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                These two are dead-set on doing good business, not so much good journalism. Their backgrounds are not in news or reporting but in tech tracking, after all. The Athletic's journalism would matter not on its own merit, but only so far as it served their business.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                And so, as is common among tech disruptors, it was only a matter of time until the mission The Athletic had advertised gradually eroded, in favor of short-term business sense. In pursuit of more product germane to more people, an editorial shift toward more "national" articles developed.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                As part of that shift, many small-market teams, including the Kings, lost their beat writers, and with them the day-to-day coverage of their teams. Although the Kings weren't wiped off the website entirely, the team only received attention tangentially, such as when their name appeared in power rankings, rumors round-ups, or some other national article.
            </p>

            <p class="break">
                "And poor Indy. Totally forgotten by The Athletic. If you subscribed for coverage of local teams, well, the joke's on you. It has a bait-and-switch feel. When I started out, we covered college hoops, the Pacers, the Colts, and had me as a columnist. Now we have one guy. He covers the Colts. Does a fine job on the Colts, but if you're a hardcore Indy sports fan, why subscribe unless you're interested in their national offerings? You don't matter to them. Too small of a market. Doesn't move the needle. Imagine, no college hoops coverage in Central Indiana. Like not covering hockey in Toronto."
                <br><br>
                <b>-- from <a href="https://bobkravitz.substack.com/p/im-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"I'm back!"</a> by Bob Kravitz, former columnist at The Athletic</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Jason Jones, meanwhile, stayed on as a staff writer to cover a different beat: culture. It's possible that he prefers this one to the Kings', in which case, good for him.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                But the Kings fan who had signed up for The Athletic got squeezed, in a pattern that so often repeats itself in this country: Impossibly low subscription pricing lures us in; our continued use of the product forms a lifestyle habit; the company waits as competitors fade away [or bleed to death, as Mather might imagine it]; and then the company gradually raises pricing and/or reneges on quality of services [see also: Uber/Lyft, Netflix/Hulu/Disney+, Amazon, Facebook, etc.].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>THE POINT</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                The Athletic's type of chicanery is a more real and serious example of a national media bias.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                It is part of the Kings fan's identity to work himself into a tizzy over some perceived slight in the latest power rankings or E.S.P.N. segment. Sometimes these grievances have merit, but mostly they're the products of a writer or producer's laziness, not some ideological bias, and anyway they're forgotten in a day or two.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                The Athletic's treatment of the Kings, meanwhile, was/is consequential and insidious. Their decision meant the loss of full seasons' worth of articles on the day-to-day happenings of the only major team in town. It isn't just that they didn't take the Kings seriously; Kings fans <i>literally know less</i> as a result of their priorities.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>PERSPECTIVE CHECK</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Given the size of the world and all its injustices, those occurring in sports journalism, in America, must rank pretty low.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Plus, the usefulness of the typical beat articles, which appear as plain text and take time to read, has never been lower, in today's more visual and fast-paced world. If you didn't watch a Kings game itself -- each one readily available I.R.L., on TV, on the N.B.C. Sports app, and via other streams -- you probably caught the highlights on YouTube, Instagram, and/or TikTok.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                And on those platforms, dozens of people -- by the strength of digital editing tools and their own creative abilities -- offer more illuminating and thorough commentary on basketball than most plain text ever has.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>MORE BACKGROUND <i>[SKIP IF UNINTERESTED IN U.S. NEWS MEDIA]</i></b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/business/new-york-times-the-athletic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times Company bought The Athletic</a> in Jan. 2022 for $550 million--an odd decision given the alternatives.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                The N.Y.T. already had a Sports section. Rather than spend half-a-billion on a new object, the Times Co. could have built out that department at a fraction of the cost.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                So why didn't it? And wasn't having both, now, redundant?
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Not officially. At first The Athletic was, in the statement of the chief exec. of the Times Co., "a great complement" to existing infrastructure. But the Sports section's 35-plus reporters and editors [and their admirers] feared it was writing on the wall.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/business/media/the-new-york-times-sports-department.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Those fears were confirmed</a> in July 2023, when the Times Co. disbanded [or guillotined, as Mather might imagine it] its Sports desk. Those journalists were reassigned to other roles [no layoffs], so that The Athletic could "now provide the bulk of the coverage of sporting events, athletes and leagues..."
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                What this accomplished, more than anything, was to put all N.Y.T. sports coverage behind a separate paywall. By bogarting it there, the Times Co. added to its "bundle" of products, which includes the main N.Y.T. as well as Cooking, Wirecutter, and Games.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Keeping sports coverage in the main N.Y.T. would have meant one less product.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Another financial advantage is that The Athletic's staff was, and remains post-purchase, non-unionized, unlike the staff of the main N.Y.T. And yet, writing by The Athletic's reporters appears in the physical N.Y.T. paper, in a section titled "Sports."
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                So while everything still appears more or less as it did, behind the scenes an entire department was de-unionized, and fewer people have access to reporting on sports.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Is this the future of news? Each category [breaking, national, international, etc.] parceled out and sold separately?
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>CONCLUSION</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Hunter Patterson is, like the rest of us, caught up in the gears of this vast machine. More to the point, he's only published [since that Kings-Raptors analysis] <a href="https://theathletic.com/4981832/2023/10/21/sacramento-kings-preseason-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one other Kings article</a>, so the hope that he may cover the Kings regularly -- given that and everything else -- seems unrealistic.
