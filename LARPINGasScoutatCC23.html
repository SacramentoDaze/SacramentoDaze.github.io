				<i>The view from Section 204, Row B, Seats 23-24</i>
			</h3>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="normal">
				At a River Cats game two days before, I'd happened to sit behind a scout for the Diamondbacks. He was scoring the game on a notebook in his lap and in the seat next to him had his standard-issue black backpack with Diamondbacks logo, little rectangular tupperwares of non-ballpark food, and on top of one of the tupperwares his phone was open to a website that he constantly refreshed.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				It was fun to think about what his life might be like: consuming ungodly amounts of baseball and traveling between minor-league cities in freedom and loneliness.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				So I wanted to give it a try, but as an amateur, and watching a more stimulating sport, and with me, in the seat next to me, my girlfriend, and knowing that after the game we'd drive home together.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				So with a pen and reporter's flipbook, I took notes.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				<b>KEEGAN MURRAY</b>
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				Considering everything, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/murrake02.html">Keegan</a> played well. He met the challenge presented to him: to be the best among lesser competition. For whatever that's worth [your mileage may vary between 'this is valuable experience' and 'this only risks injury'] he did it.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				Of course, everyone quickly overreacted. Semi-serious articles submitted these two games as evidence that Keegan rounded out the Kings' Big Three. Social media adopted the theory, excerpting [as their evidence] these articles. Kings fans bit the hook, desperate for content. So it goes. If he'd sucked we would've been worried, but explained it away somehow.

				But really, Keegan played well. The only worry is that now opponents may know to target his loose dribble, though they may have already known this.
			</p>
				
			<p class="normal">
				Keegan could be an All-Star. He could. But does he <i>personally</i> care to take on that task, and with it the insane amount of work and spartan lifestyle that that demands? Does he want to commit his <i>life</i> to this? That remains to be seen. No one can blame him if he doesn't care to. It'd just be fun for the Kings, and for us, if he does.

				<b>JORDAN FORD</b>
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				Here lies the most compelling storyline. This 6'1" A.M.A.B. was born in our valley, and played well through all four summer league games for a team with an opening at Point Guard No. 3. Who doesn't love the local kid who makes good? But it isn't just that. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				He's also interesting visually, to both his benefit and detriment. He captures the eye, but isn't classically handsome. He's fast, but small. He's smart, but slightly awkward. My girlfriend upon first seeing him immediately called him Mini Paul Giamatti. [See: Giamatti in 2004's 'Sideways,' w/ special attn. to beard style.]

				But seriously, her observation is wise. She called him Mini Giamatti when the actual Giamatti is, according to Wikipedia, 5'9". She reveals the sad truth of the situation, which is that in the highly relative world of N.B.A. basketball, the body of <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/fordjo01.html">Jordan Ford</a> is, by modern standards, almost hopelessly undersized; his instinct, skill, and hustle are coping mechanisms, but endearing ones at that.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				<b>A QUICK WORD ON A NON-KING: BRANDON MILLER</b>
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				Not piling on the guy. It's just that the teenagers in Seats 20-22 shit-talked <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millebr02.html">Miller</a> so relentlessly throughout the two days [even when the Hornets weren't playing] that he deserves a defense.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				For all his faults, he can clearly really shoot, and at 6'8" he's tall, and he's young. It sucks for the Charlotte Hornets that their No. 2 pick is currently a shooter-but-nothing-else, but that player still has value, and that's where Miller is <i>starting</i> from. His development is anybody's guess.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				If Jordan is Mini Giamatti, then Miller [with his wide-set eyes, lanky body, timidity, and potential] is Human Bambi.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				<b>KEON ELLIS</b>
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				<a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/elliske01.html">Keon</a> must empathize with Jordan, also being small for his position. This isn't so much a problem during summer league because everybody's a lil bit smaller, but it's a cap on his ultimate potential. He isn't doomed totally, it's just that his margin for error will always be smaller.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				So while he's generally played well as a King [dating back to summer league last year] he hasn't proven himself <i>exceptional</i> in any one area of the game, which he'll probably have to be in order to bend winning and losing in his favor.

				...but the feeling persists of a more pessimistic reality behind them. You could conclude that the stats [the Pts., Rebs., and Blks., in particular] should be better than they are if, like many Kings fans, you hope to see Neemy get Center No. 2 minutes this season.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				If you do hope that, you would expect to see him dominate summer league: be pretty well impenetrable around the rim, and rebound and score in at least the low teens. That level of performance would probably translate to something like a decent backup center's in the N.B.A.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				What appears to hold Queta back is his dexterity. His hands and balance are generally good, but most of his movements are slow. He's coordinated, yet it's as if his reflexes take longer to travel along his 7'0" [7'4" wingspan] body.
			</p>	
			
			<p class="normal">	
				In this way, he reminds me of a dream I have recurringly, where I'm playing a sport [usually soccer for some reason] and my leg muscles are so inexplicably sore and tight that I can't move quickly enough. But whereas I'm unathletic, Neemy isn't, so he could probably develop his dexterity. Still, I wonder if he dreams similar dreams.

				By my amateur eye, the problem started with shot selection: taking heavily-contested shots when he didn't have to.

				Like all other summer league players, Kessler is out to <i>prove something</i>. For him, that something is a regular role on an N.B.A. roster, which by the standards of summer league is a position of luxury, since his contract for next season is fully guaranteed.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				Regardless, this pressure to prove is a mind-fuck. He must on the one hand play <i>aggressively</i>, while on the other play <i>within himself</i>. He must know his limitations and push himself to those, but without thinking about them while he's doing it, because thinking only slows you down, creating another limitation.
			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				It's hard for anyone to know themselves in the best of conditions. These summer league players must do it while dumbass fans scream at them and executives decide their futures.
			</p>

				Let's see if Kessler can't recalibrate his aggressiveness-to-patience. After all, he did this much better as a regular season-King, when his role was more limited.

			</p>
			
			<p class="normal">
				We shouldn't hold our breath until he makes an All-Star team. But we see that he shoots competently, defends decently, and makes quick decisions, and we think his potential as a role player is achievable in the near future.
