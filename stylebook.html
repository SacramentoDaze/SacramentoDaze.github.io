				<b>ACRONYMS</b>
			</p>

            <p class="normal">
                When an acronym shortens full words ["Golden State Warriors"] periods separate its letters ["G.S.W."]. When an acronym shortens one word ["Miami"] no periods are used ["MIA"].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                When listing a statistic, however, no periods are used ["Field Goal Attempt" = "FGA"].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                In most all cases, an acronym is never used without first using its full words.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>BRACKETS</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                A purely aesthetic choice, instead of parentheses.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>DASHES & HYPHENS</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Dashes appear as two hyphens ["--"] and either mark an interlude in a sentence ["...this is a good time to recognize -- given the politics of most N.B.A. owners/governors -- the relative decency of the Kings'..."] or separate a sentence fragment ["...writing civil rights violations into law--mainly in the form of..."].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Hyphens ["-"] are used conventionally ["21st-most" or "A-Rod"] as well as to improve readability ["under-represented"].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>ELLIPSES</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                These are used to either mark ommitted text ["We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France,... we shall fight on the beaches,..."] or for effect ["wait a second..."].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>NUMBERING</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Numbers zero through nine are spelled out, except when there's a decimal ["2.4" or "6.8"]. Numbers 10 and above are shown as numbers.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                When listing a statistic or measurement, however, the number appears as a number, even if it's below 10 ["7 points per game" or "6'4""].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                When a number starts a sentence it is always spelled out ["Fifty-five days ago, I..."].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>OXFORD COMMA</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Yes.
            </p>
            
            <p class="normal">
				<b>PLAYER NAMES</b>
			</p>

            <p class="normal">
                At first mention, a player's full name is used ["Harrison Barnes" or "Chris Paul"]. For subsequent mentions, if that player is on the Kings, only his first name is used ["Harrison"]; if that player is not on the Kings, only his last name is used ["Paul"].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Nicknames of players ["The Black Falcon" or "CP3"], both on the Kings and not, may be used as well.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>SHORT-HAND</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Reductions of full words to fragments ["Points" to "Pts."] include a period, except when a single letter stands for an entire word ["owner/governor" to "o/g"].
            </p>
