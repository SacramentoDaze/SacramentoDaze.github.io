				Because the first Republican debate for the 2024 presidential nomination airs later today, this is a good time to recognize -- given the politics of most N.B.A. owners/governors -- the relative decency of the Kings', the oft-embattled Vivek Ranadive, whose political donations aren't nearly as damaging [it may comfort you to know] as those made by other o/gs.

                <b>THE NEWS</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexShultz/status/1686419345335898114?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Shultz of SFGATE</a> noted on Twitter/X on Aug. 1 that "The Orlando Magic appear to be the first NBA teamâ€¦ ever? to back a presidential candidate: $50k to Ron DeSantis's Super PAC."
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                What's new is that owners/governors have been known to make such donations, but not their teams themselves, until now. Probably for tax purposes.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>BACKGROUND</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                For <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/9/24/21453818/nba-owners-political-donations-trump-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ringer, John Gonzalez</a> -- as part of a long, dense, and readable story about the political donations of N.B.A. owners/governors [and their spouses] -- reported in Sept. 2020 that during that year's election cycle, 80.9% of o/gs' donations went to Republicans and Republican causes; 18.4% went to Democrats and 0.7% to nonpartisan issues [though this accounting excludes Connie [wife of Steve] Ballmer's single $7 million donation to Everytown for Gun Safety, which was considered a statistical outlier].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>BUT RE: VIVEK AND THE KINGS, SPECIFICALLY</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                In all, Gonzalez found political donations from 27 N.B.A. o/gs. Of these, Vivek is one, having donated $108,442 during the 2020 election cycle [the 21st-most out of those 27].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Vivek was one of only six o/gs who donated only to Democrats. His Kings was also one of only six or so teams whose arenas served as polling places.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Vivek is also, the story points out, one of only seven N.B.A. o/gs who aren't [at least as of Sept. 2020] white men [A-Rod may now shift the picture slightly].
            </p>

            <p class="break">
                Aggregator's Note: <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/9/24/21453818/nba-owners-political-donations-trump-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gonzalez's story</a> is worth your time. Its main point is that o/gs' public statements against racism in America only amount to lip service, since behind the scenes their money continues to fund people whose work contributes to that racism.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>MORE ON VIVEK</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ranadiv%C3%A9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his Wikipedia</a> understates it, Vivek "has been criticized during his tenure as Kings owner and blamed for their lack of success on the court." Indeed, from his 10 years as steward, he cannot look back on very many successes. Constructing the G1C, hiring Monte McNair, starting the California Classic, and the 2022-23 regular season are not followed by a long list.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Off the court, however [which Vivek, as an o/g, already technically is, but you get it], you may consider as successes things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyNM6Ldy-Ak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his address</a> to a tiny crowd of fans for the first Kings home game following Stephon Clark's death, after hundreds of protesters had blocked downtown traffic, including around the arena.
            </p>

            <p class="break">
                "We recognize that it's not just business as usual, and we are going to work really hard to bring everybody together to make the world a better place, starting with our own community, and we're going to work really hard to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again."
                <br><br>
                <b>-- Vivek's close to his address</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Although this kind of acknowledgment has become routine for most major U.S. companies now, Vivek's speech was back then "an unusual response by an owner of a major sports franchise in the immediate aftermath of a racially charged police killing," in the judgment of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/sports/stephon-clark-sacramento-kings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine Hauser of The New York Times</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Because Clark's death occurred about two months before George Floyd's, it's possible that Vivek's gesture became something of a model. In my memory, it wasn't until Floyd's killing, which received far more national attention than Clark's, that companies started to speak out against racial violence as general practice. After Floyd's death, as Gonzalez's story notes, only two N.B.A. teams [the Knicks and Spurs] didn't "immediately" issue a statement.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Of course, how much you consider Vivek's speech a "success" depends on how much stock you put in the nice things companies [and their leaders] say in service of their image, so it's hard to know how much of that was meaningful action versus just good P.R. [see: that N.Y.T. article].
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                This <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2018/4/10/17202854/stephon-clark-sacramento-kings-protests-vivek-ranadive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB Nation story by Tyler Tynes</a>, which follows up on the situation in Sacramento after Vivek's speech, shows a lot of evidence that suggests it's mostly P.R. Sadly, that still clears the bar set by most N.B.A. o/gs.
            </p>

                <b>CORRUPTION PLAGUES BOTH MAJOR U.S. PARTIES</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Make no mistake: Many Democrats are [to use a slightly extreme word] implicated in these big money donations and, by extension, the corrupt nature of national U.S. politics as a whole.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Note for example Gonzalez's mention of a <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/billionaire-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 study</a>, by <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/americans-for-tax-fairness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans for Tax Fairness</a> and the <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/institute-for-policy-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute for Policy Studies</a>, which found that, "broadly speaking, billionaires tend to give somewhat equally to both political parties."
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                But it's also true that, as a general rule, Democrats aren't the ones currently busying themselves by writing civil rights violations into law--mainly in the form of [to use a slightly generous word] restrictions to medical care that is, in the consensus of our leading medical institutions, good for the health of kids experiencing gender dysphoria.
            </p>

            <p class="break">
                This <a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/healthcare_youth_medical_care_bans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map by the Movement Advancement Project</a> shows that 21 states varyingly ban "best-practice" health care and/or medication. Moreover, 5 states [Alabama, Idaho, Florida, North Dakota, Oklahoma] outright criminalize best-practice care.
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, 14 states [plus D.C.] have "shield" laws protecting transgender health care.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                This kind of lawmaking -- terrorizing a minority group of human beings as a way to take political power -- is one of the worst American traditions there is. Transgender folks are only its latest target. Black folks have of course been its historical favorite [see: slavery, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Crow</a> laws, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern strategy</a>, police violence, etc.]. Asian folks have also suffered from it, especially during the pandemic. Latino folks know it well, especially here in California. And Native American folks...
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                So: Most federal politicians, and those directly responsible for their success, are implicated in corruption; but there should be special scrutiny for those who are part of active discrimination against certain peoples, and those folks tend to be [or fund the work of] Republicans.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                <b>THE TAKEAWAY</b>
            </p>

            <p class="normal">
                Respect Vivek's basic social decency and appreciate his first successful season in charge. But remember that what he's running is mostly a business, so continue to enjoy Kings tickets, gear, and concessions responsibly.
            </p>
